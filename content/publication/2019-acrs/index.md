abstract: Solar energy is a promising renewable energy source, but stable generation of photovoltaic (PV) power is largely impaired by meteorological phenomena. Ground-based weather measurements are limited in their ability to fully capture the unpredictable nature of meteorological conditions. However, remotely-sensed satellite imagery can offer crucial information on the atmosphere and the local environment, providing a broader perspective for more accurate PV estimation. This study proposes a novel Deep Convolutional Network (DCNN) framework, which integrates meteorological satellite imagery, meteorological elements, and past PV measurements to predict short-term PV power. The performance of the proposed model for solar energy prediction was tested on a solar power plant located in South Korea. Results demonstrated that the DCNN model successfully learned the complex meteorological factors such as cloud motion and solar irradiance by integrating stacked multi-temporal COMS images with ground-based meteorological data and previous PV data as input sources. In addition, we confirmed that the use of multi-temporal, multi-band meteorological satellite image significantly improves the prediction accuracy. These results were confirmed by evaluating the normalized mean absolute error of the solar energy output which indicated the proposed modelâ€™s effectiveness for short-term PV power predictions.
